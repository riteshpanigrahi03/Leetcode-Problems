//Explanation
// I will explain you how I worked up my solution. Lets get basic case right first. 
// Sum of the given array must be a multiple of 3 for any chance of it having 3 partitions.
// Next we create a suffix array, which will have a note of position where the sum is (sum/3) from the end.
// Therefore when we iterate from front, (keeping sum count) as soon as we reach (sum/3) let say at i, 
// we have probably got our 1st part(still there can be a chance that 3 partitions wonâ€™t exist).
//  Now as we are looking for 3 parts, the 3rd part will start from i+2 or thereafter (2nd part can be at i+1).
//   Therefore from i+2 position we check on our suffix array for instances where we tagged positions as 1. In all the places we find that,
//  we have a successful case of 3 partition and we increase a totalCount by 1. 
// Then we resume from out i th index and do the same again when the sum is (sum/3).
